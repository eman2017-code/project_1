## USER STORIES
- The user will be able to select the amount of players that will be playing
- The user will be able to create their own user profile
- The user will be able to select their difficulty level
  - If user select easy, the words will move slowly at first
  - If the user selects medium, the words, will move a normal rate of speed
  - If the user selects fast, the words will move 2x as times as the medium and more words will initially appear on the screen
- The user will be able to type the words that are floating across the screen
  - If the user does not type a word in the time, he will lose a life
  - If the user loses all of the lives, the game will end 
  - If the user does type a word before it hits the end of the screen, the word will disappear, no lives will be lost 
  - If the user has typed all the words, he will move onto the next round
  - If the user lost any lives in the previous round, those lives will be replaced to full capacity once again
- The speed of the words will move faster and the amount of words will increase as well
- See if they have lost or won the round
  - “Congrats! You passed this level!”
  - “Oh No! Better luck next time + userName”
- See the amount of the level that they have left to go 
- This will be displayed with the progress bar at the bottom of the screen
- See the amount of lives that they have left in the game 
- See top right of the screen

# EXTRA THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INCLUDE
- Have the user choose a character that represents them and as they type the words, a laser shoots out towards the word that -   they are typing and explodes when they have typed the word correctly
- Show the typing speed of the user
- The leaderboard section that shows how they performed against other players that have played the game
- Be able to have the user move their character around and have the words try and “attack” them
